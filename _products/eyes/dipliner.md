This smudge-proof, richly colored liner is easy to use—the pointed tip of the short applicator makes gliding the product easy even for make-up newbies. It has a shimmery finish, is gentle, and dries quickly in under a minute.  So say goodbye  to fanning your eyes in the hopes that you won’t end up with eyeliner everywhere. It’s available in black and brown for both nighttime and daytime.
