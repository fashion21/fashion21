This mascara highlights your eyes like no other. Its special formula is designed to make your lashes two times longer and stronger the moment you apply it without weighing your eyes down. This mascara also lasts for a long time without running or smudging, and the unique, fine-bristled wand lets you glide this product on easily without having to worry about clumping. No wonder itâ€™s considered one of the best, if not the best, mascaras around by local makeup gurus. For best results, curl your lashes with an eyelash curler first. Then, starting at the base of your upper lashes, gently draw the wand upward until you reach the tips. Hold the wand vertically and run it across your lower lashes to color them.
